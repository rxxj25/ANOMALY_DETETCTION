# Anomaly Detection using Python

This project implements an Anomaly Detection system using Python libraries, designed to identify outliers or anomalies in a dataset. The project leverages various statistical and machine learning techniques to detect unusual data points that deviate significantly from normal patterns. It also uses visualizations in the form of graphs to help with the interpretation of results.



## Overview
This project aims to detect anomalies in datasets using various anomaly detection techniques, including:
- Statistical methods like Z-score and IQR
- Machine learning methods like Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, Local Outlier factor, MAD,One-Class SVM

The anomalies detected are visualized using graphs (e.g., scatter plots, box plots) to show how well the system identifies outliers.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling datasets.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For plotting and visualizing data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms like Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, One-Class SVM, and more.
- **SciPy**: For statistical methods such as Z-score and IQR-based anomaly detection.
